        <h1>My Time Living in Vegas</h1>
        <main>
           <p>
             So I briefly lived in Las Vegas or about a year when I was 
             working in the construction industry (before I knew how to code).
             Obviouly the city lives up to its reputation in certain 
             respects, but it also has some nice local spots for those
             who live their and don't go to the strip.
           </p>
           <p>
             I was working on a powerline construction project at the time 
             and before I got an apartment I lived out of a hotel room. The 
             first hotel I lived out of was called the Gold Strike Casino 
             in Jean NV. It was about 30 minutes outside of the downtown vegas 
             and only real gamblers and retirees went to blow their money there.
             I can say that it was probably the most depression and weirdest place 
             I lived. Every night as I came back from work I would have to cross 
             the smoke filled casino floor and see all the sad gamblers.
           </p>
           <p>
             One cool thing about living out there were the hidden gems that we would 
             dig up from time to time. One of those was the Pioneer Salon, where me and
             my co-worker would go once a week to grab a burger. It was near the location 
             where a DC-3 plane carrying Carole Lombard, a famous actress, crashed in 1942.
